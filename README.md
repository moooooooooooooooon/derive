## Site 1
* https://www.pokemon.com/us/
* I just googled what I like. 
* This website looks pretty trendy. When I open the website, the content blocks show up nicely.
* The navigation system seems cute. Rainbow colours are used for it. Also, I think the sections are well devided, so it's easy to find     things.
* There is a user dashboard to log in and to see my information on the left side. And I can search what I want to see easily in a         Pokédex section.
* I think the website seems very interesting. Many bright colours are used for the users, and those make the website cool. I also like     how the secions are devided.
* I feel like a lot of information is going on in the blocks including the pictures and the sentences, so I think it looks a little bit   busy. I would like to change the blocks, but other things look really good and trendy.

## Site 2
* https://www.dunkindonuts.com/en
* I googled the company name directly, and I got the website. I like Dunkin Donuts♡
* I like this website because it seems very current, and I like I can turn on and off the high contrast mode.
* When I hover the navigation part, it slowly changes the colour of the text and the box. If I click the boxes, it shows the details of   each part that I can move on. It is really easy to use and find things.
* In a navigation part, I can search the locations of the stores, and there is a small box which has its own box shape to log in and see   my information.
* I feel this is really interesting, and I like that it moves when I hover the contents, the use of colours which are representative of   this company, and the simple design and organization.
* I would like to change the back-to-top box to stay where it is located now because if I go down more than the specific part, the back-   to-top box repeats to disappear and show up whenever I scroll up and down. But I don't think it really bothers to look around the       website.

## Site 3
* https://playskool.hasbro.com/en-ca
* I saw my PLAYSKOOL crayons, so I googled the company.
* It seems to be simply organized, and I feel it is a little bit trendy. I think it's not bad. 
* The navigation system looks simple and familiar because it has the company name and the categories like other websites have. I think     it's not bad to use, but when I hover and click the navigation part (each category), I can see the empty space between the contents.     Also, the letters are about to touch the borders of the box.
* There's a small box that I can search whatever I want on the top of the page. And I can change the languages of the website if I click   the small globe.
* I feel a little bit of inconvenience because if I want to see more products, it loads another page to see them. I think it has a small   amount of the contents on the main page. Every part says "more" products or "more" videos.
* In my opinion, if the category boxes are wider than the original in navigation system, I think it'll look cleaner.

## Site 4
* https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/
* This website is where I go sometimes.
* It looks clean. It's simply designed with white and black,and the photos move automatically. I think it's trendy.
* The navigation system seems to be well devided, so it's easy to use. However, if I move my cursor to outside of the contents, it         disappears.
* The header has many parts that I can search what I want to see, log in to my account and change the language and so on. The most parts   of the header are made for users, so people can interact and see easily.
* I feel this looks pretty nice. It is useful and clean. It has simple icons and a lot of approaches to get into wherever I want to go.
* One thing I would like change is the size of the logo. Most people know about the company when they see the logo, so I think it's a     good way to make the size of the logo bigger on the website.

## Site 5
* https://www.shopdisney.com/
* I got the website from social media. I followed the link from the Disney instagram account.
* This website looks current because a lot of pictures are going on the page, and they react when I hover. Also, I think the simple and   thin font works for trendy style.
* The navigation system seems to be well designed. It looks clean, so it's easy to see and use. I like the thin line appears at the       bottom of the categories when I hover any part in the navigation system.
* On the top of the page, the header has the contents that I can find locations of stores and sign in and so on.
* I feel this is really well designed and organized. The large pictures appeal to people to look at them, and I can feel the pictures     are coming to me when I hover. Also, the bottom of the page has many menus that I can get into. I think this website is pretty           interesting and useful.
* I like all things, but if I should have one thing I would change, I would say to make the photos a little bit smaller. However, I feel   the current design is pretty good.
